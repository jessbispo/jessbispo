## Hi :blue_heart:

- ðŸŒŽ Based in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil
- :star2: Iâ€™m currently focused on building foundational knowledge for both Software Engineer (mostly C++, Python and Java) and Data Engineer (Dedicating a lot of my time to study for a Professional Data Engineer certification)
- :sparkling_heart: I love trying new hobbies, as sports, baking, reading, writing and others!

Here's a quick guide to what each of my GitHub repositories represents: 

- :notebook_with_decorative_cover: for notes that i took in class
- ðŸ“š for continuous learning and studies
- :pager: for my personal projects
